#### **Binocular Rivalry** ####

Binocular rivalry occurs when the two eyes see different images
(either using mirrors, polarisation, or colored glasses). Rather
than seeing these images superimposed, observers see a rhythmic
alternation between them, with periods of superimposition or
piecemeal images in between.

This alternation is thought to be driven by mutual inhibition
between the two images. I have therefore tried to use it as a
proxy measure of the Excitation/Inhibition ratio in the brain.
