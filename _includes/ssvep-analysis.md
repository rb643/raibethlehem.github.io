#### **SSVEP Analysis** ####

I'm also working on a package that makes it easier to analyse
steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs). This package
will include functions that analyse neural oscillations based on
the prior information of what frequency you used to stimulate
the participant.
It will hopefully also make it easy to identify and analyse
harmonics, intermodulation frequencies, and signal-to-noise
ratios of SSVEPs.

The project isn't ready for release yet, but if you're
interested, get in touch.
