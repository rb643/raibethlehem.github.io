#### **Eye Tracking** ####

I've worked on some code that allows you to do eye tracking more
easily with psychopy and tobii eyetrackers.

This is primarily minor tweaks to a script written by Sogo
Hiroyuki, but also includes a few functions that make life much
easier - such as a function that mirrors the eyes on the display
to let you move the screen and participant in the right
position, and a smoother calibration function.
