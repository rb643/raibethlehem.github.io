## Research

I study visual perception in clinical populations. Many
psychiatric conditions feature atypical sensory processing,
which can be caused by the same underlying processes that
are causing core symptoms. By studying how people see
the world, I hope to find out more about fundamental
brain mechanisms in clinical conditions.
Using vision science to study these conditions has
the benefit of being cheap, non-invasive, and quick.
