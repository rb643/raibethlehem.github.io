#### **Face Categorisation** ####

I'm also interested in face categorisation. At the moment, I am
mostly curious about the early stages of face perception, and in
 particular the simple distinction between a face and a
 different object. I'm using an experimental paradigm from the
 [Face Categorisation Lab](http://face-categorization-lab.webnode.com),
 who were kind enough to send me their stimuli. The experiment is
 designed to detect a signature of face processing using steady-state
 visual evoked potentials.

 It does so by flashing random images rhythmically.
 Periodically, the image flashed will be a face, and at the
 frequency at which faces are shown, a clear response can be
 detected.
