#### **Binocular Adaptation** ####

Given the interesting finding of a slower rate of binocular
rivalry in autism, I was interested in whether adapting to an
image - the process in which neural responses to an image reduce
when seeing it for an extended period - was causing it.

I developed a paradigm in which I adapted the viewer to an image
before binocular rivalry in two ways: at a very basic level, and
at a slightly higher level.

It showed no real difference in adaptation between an autistic
and a control group, and also proved to be a neat way to study
contributions of different levels of the visual hierarchy to
rivalry. You can find a [draft of this project here](/pubs/adaptation-paper-4.pdf), and try the
