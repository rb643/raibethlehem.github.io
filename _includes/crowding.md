#### **Visual Crowding** ####

Visual crowding occurs when lots of objects are close to each other in peripheral vision. While it's easy to see that there are objects in your peripheral vision, it becomes harder to identify each individual object.

This presents a fundamental limit to perceiving all objects in our visual field. Since perception of many details is sometimes linked to autism, I recently checked if crowding is weaker in autism.

In some ways this represents a follow-up to an earlier project I was involved in in which we found [slightly more narrowly focused attention in autism.](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/16/6776) [(PDF)](/pubs/6776.full.pdf)

You can find the resulting paper here:
